For you, the value of the guide is in being able to quickly and easily teach stakeholders about your project management concepts.

If students are able to skim what's in this book, they will have an advantage when they go for job interviews and encounter this lingo.


## Why am I creating this?

I am creating this ebook because of  years of experience in consulting work, with a wide range of clients, from small startups to enormous enterprises. This kind of business lingo is present in many of the projects and at many of the clients.


### For team collaboration

When I work with companies and teams, then I'm able to use glossaries like this one to help create shared context and clearer communication. This can accelerate working together, and can help teams forge better project plans, in my direct experience.

For example, one of my enterprise clients describes this kind of shared context and clear communication in a positive sense as "singing from the same songbook". When a team understands project management terminology, and has a quick easy glossary for definitions and explanations, then it's akin to teammates with the same songbook.


### For cross-cultural communication

What I discovered is that these kinds of glossaries can be especially helpful for teams with members coming from various cultures, such as from different countries, or different industries, or different ways of working. The topic pages help provide a baseline for better collaboration.

What I discovered with teammates from non-Western or non-English backgrounds is that business has many social quotations, aphorisms, and idioms that come up frequently and that that teammates are expected to know.

For example, my peers in San Francisco Bay Area startups will likely know the lingo "Get on the front foot". But it turns out this idiom isn't immediately familiar to many people from many other places. The topic pages cover idioms, to improve shared understanding.
