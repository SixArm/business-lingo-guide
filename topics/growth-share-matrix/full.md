# Growth-Share Matrix

The Growth-Share Matrix, also known as the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix, is a strategic planning tool used by businesses to analyze and categorize their product portfolio based on market growth rate and relative market share. The matrix classifies products into four quadrants, each with its own strategic implications.

|             | High Share | Low Share |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| High Growth | Stars      | Questions |
| Low Growth  | Cash Cows  | Dogs      |

Stars:
* High market growth rate and high relative market share.
* Stars are products that have a significant market share in a rapidly growing market.
* They require substantial investment to maintain their growth and market leadership position.
* Businesses typically allocate resources to support and develop stars, with the goal of turning them into cash cows in the future.

Cash Cows:
* Low market growth rate and high relative market share.
* Cash cows are products that have a dominant market share in a slow or mature market.
* They generate a stable and significant cash flow.
* Cash cows require relatively low investment and are considered a source of funds for investing in other products or businesses.

Questions a.k.a. Problems:
* High market growth rate and low relative market share.
* Question marks are products operating in high-growth markets but with a relatively small market share.
* They require careful consideration as they have the potential for future growth, but also pose the risk of not achieving market dominance.
* Strategic decisions involve determining whether to invest to increase market share or divest if the market potential is uncertain.

Dogs:
* Low market growth rate and low relative market share.
* Dogs are products operating in slow or declining markets with a small market share.
* They generate minimal profit and may not have strong growth prospects.
* Businesses may choose to divest or minimize investment in dogs unless they serve a strategic purpose.

The Growth-Share Matrix helps businesses analyze their product portfolio, allocate resources, and develop appropriate strategies for each category. It provides a framework for identifying growth opportunities, managing cash flow, and making informed decisions about investment, divestment, or product development.
