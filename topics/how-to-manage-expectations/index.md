# How to manage expectations

Managing expectations is essential for maintaining strong relationships, avoiding misunderstandings, and achieving successful outcomes.

* **Be Clear:** Communicate openly with all parties involved. Articulate goals, deliverables, timelines, constraints, and limitations.

* **Be Realistic:** Ensure expectations are realistic and aligned with the project scope, resources, and constraints. Avoid overpromising.

* **Confirm Communications:** Put expectations in writing. Use project charters, scope statements, or formal contracts to document and confirm the agreed-upon expectations.

* **Provide Updates:** Apprise stakeholders by sharing regular updates, status reports, meeting results, and progress notes. This helps ensure stakeholders are in the loop, and expectations are current.

* **Manage Changes:** Have a process in place to manage changes. Assess the impact of changes on the project timeline, budget, and resources, and communicate the consequences to stakeholders.

* **Provide Rationale:** Help stakeholders understand the reasoning of decisions, constraints, and plans. Provide rationale and context for any changes that may affect expectations.

* **Involve Stakeholders:** Involve stakeholders in relevant decision-making processes. Seek their input and include them in discussions to ensure their expectations are considered.

* **Address Issues:** When there are issues or conflicts, address them promptly and directly. Engage in open respectful discussions to understand concerns and find solutions.

* **Manage Risk:** Identify and manage potential risks and uncertainties that may affect expectations. Have contingency plans in place to address unexpected events or changes.
