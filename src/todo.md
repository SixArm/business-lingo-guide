Back to square on
Ballpark number/figure
By the book
Cut-throat
Easy come, easy go
Game plan
Get down to business
Get something off the ground
Go down the drain
Go the extra mile
Hands are tied
In a nutshell
In the driver’s seat
Keep one’s eye on the ball
Learn the ropes
Long shot
No-brainer
No strings attached
Not going to fly
On the same page
Out in the open
Put all one’s eggs in one basket
Put the cart before the horse
Raise the bar
Rock the boat
Safe bet
Same boat
See eye to eye
See something through
Sever ties
Shoot something down
Smooth sailing
Stand one’s ground
Talk someone into something
Talk someone out of something
The elephant in the room
Think outside the box
Time’s up
Twist someone’s arm
Up in the air
Uphill battle
Upper hand
Word of mouth
