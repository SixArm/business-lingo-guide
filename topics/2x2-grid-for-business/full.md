# 2x2 grid for business

Here's an example of a 2x2 grid commonly used in business for strategic analysis or decision-making. This grid helps assess the attractiveness of different markets or market segments and evaluate a business's competitive position within those markets.

|                              | High Market Attractiveness     | Low Market Attractiveness |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Strong Competitive Position  | Invest, Grow                   | Protect, Harvest          |
| Weak Competitive Position    | Build, Exit                    | Divest, Retire            |

Quadrant 1: Invest/Grow: This quadrant represents markets or market segments with high attractiveness and where the business holds a strong competitive position. It suggests focusing resources and efforts to further expand and capitalize on these opportunities.

Quadrant 2: Protect/Harvest: Markets in this quadrant have high attractiveness but the business's competitive position is weak. The recommendation is to protect existing market share and optimize profitability while considering strategies to improve the competitive position.

Quadrant 3: Build/Exit: These are markets with low attractiveness but where the business holds a strong competitive position. The focus should be on maintaining the competitive advantage while exploring opportunities to transition or pivot into more attractive markets.

Quadrant 4: Divest/Retire: Markets in this quadrant have low attractiveness, and the business's competitive position is weak. It suggests considering divestment or exiting these markets to allocate resources to more promising areas.

This grid provides a framework to evaluate market opportunities, competitive advantages, and make strategic decisions regarding resource allocation, growth strategies, and market positioning.

Please note that the specific labels and strategies within the grid can vary depending on the context and industry. It's important to adapt the grid to suit your business's unique circumstances and objectives.
