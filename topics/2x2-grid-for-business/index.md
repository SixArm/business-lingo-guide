Here's an example of a 2x2 grid commonly used in business for strategic analysis or decision-making. This grid helps assess market attractiveness and competitive strength.

|                              | High Market Attractiveness     | Low Market Attractiveness |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Strong Competitive Position  | Invest, Grow                   | Protect, Harvest          |
| Weak Competitive Position    | Build, Exit                    | Divest, Retire            |

* **Quadrant 1: Invest/Grow**: Markets with high attractiveness and where the business holds a strong competitive position. Focus work to further expand and capitalize on these opportunities.

* **Quadrant 2: Protect/Harvest**: Markets with high attractiveness but where the business has a weak competitive position. Protect existing market share, and optimize profitability, while considering strategies to improve the position.

* **Quadrant 3: Build/Exit**: Markets with low attractiveness but where the business holds a strong competitive position. Focus on maintaining the competitive advantage while exploring opportunities to transition or pivot into more attractive markets.

* **Quadrant 4: Divest/Retire**: Markets with low attractiveness and where the business's competitive position is weak. Divest or exiting these markets to allocate resources to more promising areas.

This grid provides a framework to evaluate market opportunities, competitive advantages, and make strategic decisions regarding resource allocation, growth strategies, and market positioning.
