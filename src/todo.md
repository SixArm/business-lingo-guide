VRIO Analysis. VRIO analysis is used to analyze the internal resources of a company. It identifies attributes that a company’s resources must have in order to provide a competitive advantage. The analysis involves asking four questions with regard to the resources. Valuable: If a resource can help find opportunities or defend against threats it can be considered valuable. Moreover, a valuable resource should help increase customer value. Rare: If a resource can only be acquired by one or a few companies, it is considered rare. A resource that is valuable and rare will provide a significant competitive advantage. Costly to imitate: If other organizations that don’t have the resource can’t imitate it, buy it or find a substitute for it at a reasonable price, that resource is considered costly to imitate. Organized to capture value: The organization should have processes, policies, and systems in place to capture the value created by valuable, rare and costly to imitate resources.
