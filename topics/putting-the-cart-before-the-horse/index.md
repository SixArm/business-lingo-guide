# Putting the cart before the horse

The idiom "putting the cart before the horse" means doing things in the wrong order or prioritizing things incorrectly. It implies that the natural or logical sequence of events or actions has been reversed or mixed up.

The phrase originates from the literal scenario of a horse pulling a cart. In this traditional setup, the horse is positioned in front of the cart and leads the way. However, if someone were to put the cart in front of the horse, it would be inefficient and illogical since the horse would have nothing to pull.

Metaphorically, "putting the cart before the horse" is used to caution against taking actions out of sequence or neglecting proper prioritization. It suggests that it's important to follow a logical order or prioritize tasks correctly to achieve the desired outcome efficiently.

For example, if someone is planning a project, "putting the cart before the horse" would mean implementing or focusing on the details or specific tasks before establishing clear goals, objectives, or a strategic plan. It emphasizes the importance of proper planning and considering the logical sequence of steps to ensure success.

In general, the phrase is a reminder to consider the natural order of events or actions and to avoid rushing into things without proper preparation or foresight.
