GE-McKinsey Nine-Box Matrix, Ansoff Matrix, VRIO Analysis.

GE-McKinsey Nine-Box Matrix. This strategy tool helps business portfolio planning. Multi-business corporations use it to evaluate their individual business units and prioritize investments among them systematically. In the matrix, the y-axis represents the market/ industry attractiveness, and the x-axis shows the strength of the business unit. The scale is high, medium and low. It generates nine industry attractiveness measures and twelve business strengths measures.  

Ansoff Matrix. Businesses use the Ansoff matrix to analyze and plan strategies for growth and understand associated risks. According to the matrix, there are two approaches to building a growth strategy; By varying what is sold (product growth);    By varying who it is sold to (market growth).

Scenario Planning. Scenario planning involves creating and brainstorming around possible future scenarios and understand how they would affect the objectives of the company. It helps companies develop effective strategies.

Value Chain Analysis. This strategy tool helps organizations analyze their internal firm activities. It helps identify which activities are most valuable to the company and which ones can be improved for competitive advantage. 

VRIO Analysis. VRIO analysis is used to analyze the internal resources of a company. It identifies attributes that a company’s resources must have in order to provide a competitive advantage. The analysis involves asking four questions with regard to the resources. Valuable: If a resource can help find opportunities or defend against threats it can be considered valuable. Moreover, a valuable resource should help increase customer value. Rare: If a resource can only be acquired by one or a few companies, it is considered rare. A resource that is valuable and rare will provide a significant competitive advantage. Costly to imitate: If other organizations that don’t have the resource can’t imitate it, buy it or find a substitute for it at a reasonable price, that resource is considered costly to imitate. Organized to capture value: The organization should have processes, policies, and systems in place to capture the value created by valuable, rare and costly to imitate resources.
