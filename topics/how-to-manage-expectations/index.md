# How to manage expectations

Managing expectations is essential for maintaining strong relationships, avoiding misunderstandings, and achieving successful outcomes.

Use Clear Communication: Communicate openly and honestly with all parties involved. Articulate goals, deliverables, timelines, constraints, and limitations. Avoid jargon. Avoid ambiguity.

Be Realistic: Ensure expectations are realistic and aligned with the project scope, resources, and constraints. Avoid overpromising or committing to unrealistic timelines or outcomes.

Confirm Agreements: Put agreements, decisions, and expectations in writing. Use project charters, scope statements, or formal contracts to document and confirm the agreed-upon expectations.

Provide Updates: Keep stakeholders informed about the progress of the project. Provide regular updates, status reports, or progress meetings to ensure stakeholders are aware of status and any changes.

Manage Changes: Have a process in place to manage changes. Assess the impact of changes on the project timeline, budget, and resources, and communicate the consequences to stakeholders.

Provide Rationale: Help stakeholders understand the reasoning behind decisions or limitations that may affect their expectations. Provide rationale and context for any constraints, trade-offs, or changes.

Involve Stakeholders: Involve stakeholders in relevant decision-making processes. Seek their input and include them in discussions to ensure their expectations are considered.

Address Issues: If there are conflicts or issues related to expectations, address them promptly and directly. Engage in open respectful discussions to understand concerns and find agreeable solutions.

Manage Risk Proactively: Identify and manage potential risks and uncertainties that may affect expectations. Have contingency plans in place to address unexpected events or changes.
