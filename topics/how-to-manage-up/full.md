# How to manage up

Managing up is the practice of proactively working with your supervisor or manager to build a strong and productive working relationship while effectively communicating your needs, accomplishments, and goals. Here are some tips to help you manage up effectively:

* Understand Your Manager's Style: Observe your manager's communication and work style preferences. Pay attention to their priorities, expectations, and decision-making process. Adapt your approach and communication to align with their preferences.

* Build Trust and Rapport: Cultivate a positive working relationship based on trust, respect, and open communication. Deliver your work with quality and consistency, be reliable, and demonstrate a proactive and collaborative attitude.

* Communicate Clearly and Proactively: Keep your manager informed about your work progress, challenges, and accomplishments. Be proactive in sharing updates, seeking feedback, and discussing any issues that may affect your work. Clearly communicate your needs, expectations, and any support you require to perform at your best.

* Understand and Align with Goals: Gain a clear understanding of your manager's and the organization's goals and priorities. Align your work and objectives with those goals to demonstrate your commitment to the larger vision. Seek clarification if needed and ensure your work supports the broader objectives.

* Anticipate Needs and Be Proactive: Anticipate your manager's needs by staying aware of upcoming projects, deadlines, and potential challenges. Take the initiative to offer assistance, suggest solutions, or provide relevant information before being asked. Show initiative and take ownership of your work.

* Seek Feedback and Act on It: Request feedback from your manager on your performance, strengths, and areas for improvement. Act on the feedback and incorporate it into your work. Regularly check in with your manager to ensure you are aligned with their expectations.

* Manage Expectations: Clarify expectations about deliverables, deadlines, and quality standards early on. Discuss any concerns or constraints that may impact your ability to meet those expectations. Be realistic about what you can deliver and propose alternative solutions if necessary.

* Be Solutions-Oriented: When facing challenges or problems, come prepared with potential solutions or options. Demonstrate problem-solving skills and a proactive mindset. Present your ideas thoughtfully, and be open to feedback or alternative suggestions.

* Foster Collaboration: Foster a collaborative relationship with your manager and colleagues. Seek opportunities to work together, share ideas, and support each other's success. Offer assistance and contribute to team goals beyond your own responsibilities.

* Continuously Learn and Develop: Take ownership of your professional development and keep improving your skills and knowledge. Seek opportunities to learn from your manager's expertise and guidance. Demonstrate a growth mindset and a willingness to take on new challenges.

Remember, managing up is not about manipulating or pleasing your manager but about building a mutually beneficial relationship based on trust, open communication, and shared goals. By effectively managing up, you can enhance your professional growth, visibility, and contribute to the overall success of your team and organization.
